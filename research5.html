        Despite LLMs' remarkable writing abilities and their seeming 
                        omniscience, their consistency and as a result, trustworthiness, are in doubt. We can't 
                        reasonably claim LLMs possess an "opinion" and "ability to think" before we have systematically 
                        evaluated their consistency of responses across prompts with regard to same essence. 
                        Under the mentorship of Professor Yangfeng Ji, I am working on evaluating how consistent LLMs' political leaning is. 
        I utilized headlines from news articles and tested LLMs using various prompt framings, using different pronouns while maintaining the core essence.
        The headlines were sourced from Allsides.com, the DailyBeast, Breitbart, and were scraped using Selenium and Beautifulsoup. My evaluation involved querying the OpenAI API with both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
