        This LLM-Finetuning Codebase is dedicated to provide a high-level command line API for NLP researchers to easily 
        fine-tune popular open-source LLMs such as Llams-2, Falcon, and Flan-T5 and do inference. This codebase employs Low Rank Approximation (LoRA) and Prefix-Tuning to 
        enable researchers to fine-tune LLMs with limited GPU computation power.
        Our codebase also supports In-Context-Learning (ICL) and popular platforms such as wandb.
