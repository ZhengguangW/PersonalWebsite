      For modern Large Language Models (LLMs), while they excel at creative writing, often produce unreliable text summarizations (hallucination).
      On the other hand, traditional statistical NLP using Part-of-Speech tagging generates more reliable yet less fluent summary. 
      I am investigating if there is a way to make these two methods complement each other such as incorporating POS tagging into LLMs to do multi-objective learning.
