      Interpreting deep learning time series models is crucial in
      understanding the modelâ€™s behavior and learning patterns
      from raw data for real-time decision-making. However, the
      complexity inherent in transformer-based time series models
      poses challenges in explaining the impact of individual features on predictions. In this study, we leverage recent local
      interpretation methods to interpret state-of-the-art time series
      models. To use real-world datasets, we collected three years
      of daily case data for 3,142 US counties. Firstly, we compare
      six transformer-based models and choose the best prediction
      model for COVID-19 infection. Using 13 input features from
      the last two weeks, we can predict the cases for the next
      two weeks. Secondly, we present an innovative way to evaluate the prediction sensitivity to 8 population age groups over
      highly dynamic multivariate infection data. Thirdly, we compare our proposed perturbation-based interpretation method
      with related work, including a total of eight local interpretation methods. Finally, we apply our framework to traffic
      and electricity datasets, demonstrating that our approach is
      generic and can be applied to other time-series domains.
