<p class="Research-Text" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> The UVA Machine Learning & System group is actively engaged in AI research, particularly in the domain of AI4Science. 
    I am proud to have been a part of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UVwyaaKuqKX30_MOGXs8VYADVIW86rAb/edit#slide=id.p15" target="_blank" class="Research-Text-link"> Global Pervasive Computational Epidemiology (GPCE) project, which focused on interpreting county-level COVID-19 infections using deep learning for time series </a>. 
    Our group won the <a href="https://conferences.computer.org/icdh/2023/student_awards.html" target="_blank" class="Research-Text-link"> 3rd prize at the IEEE ICDH 2023 conference </a>. 
    In this project, I had the privilege of leading a team that developed an <a href="https://zhengguangw.github.io/GPCE-COVID-Website/" class="Research-Text-link">interactive project website</a> to enhance our research's accessibility and impact.
    Building on the success of the GPCE project, our group run more experiments on Sensitivity Analysis methods on County-Level COVID Data. As a coauthor, our group's paper <a href="Age_Sensitivity___AAAI_2024_Workshop.pdf" target="_blank" class="Research-Text-link"><em style="color:#E57200"> 
      Interpreting Time Series Transformer Models and Sensitivity Analysis of Population Age Groups to COVID-19 Infections</em> </a> is accepted to the AAAI'24 Workshop AI4TS:AI For Time Series Analysis.
