  Interpretable machine learning plays a key role in
  healthcare because it is challenging in understanding feature
  importance in deep learning model predictions. We propose
  a novel framework that uses deep learning to study feature
  sensitivity for model predictions. This work combines sensitivity
  analysis with heterogeneous time-series deep learning model
  prediction, which corresponds to the interpretations of Spatiotemporal features from what the model has actually learned.
  We forecast county-level COVID-19 infection using the Temporal
  Fusion Transformer (TFT). We then use the sensitivity analysis
  extending Morris Method to see how sensitive the outputs are
  with respect to perturbation to our static and dynamic input
  features. The significance of the work is grounded in a realworld COVID-19 infection prediction with highly non-stationary,
  finely granular, and heterogeneous data. 1) Our model can
  capture the detailed daily changes of temporal and spatial model
  behaviors and achieves high prediction performance compared to
  a PyTorch baseline. 2) By analyzing the Morris sensitivity indices
  and attention patterns, we decipher the meaning of feature
  importance with observational population and dynamic model
  changes. 3) We have collected 2.5 years of socioeconomic and
  health features over 3142 US counties, such as observed cases and
  deaths, and a number of static (age distribution, health disparity,
  and industry) and dynamic features (vaccination, disease spread,
  transmissible cases, and social distancing). Using the proposed
  framework, we conduct extensive experiments and show our
  model can learn complex interactions and perform predictions
  for daily infection at the county level. Being able to model
  the disease infection with a hybrid prediction and description
  accuracy measurement with Morris index at the county level is a
  central idea that sheds light on individual feature interpretation
  via sensitivity analysis.
